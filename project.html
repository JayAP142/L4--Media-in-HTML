            Deforestation <br>
            Overgrazing <br>
            Mining <br>
        </ul></p>
        
        <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
        Water pollution is the addition of impurities into waterbodies, making them unfit for use. Examples of activities that destroy waterbodies are:
        <ul>Dumping solid and liquid waste into waterbodies <br>
            Fishing with chemicals <br>
            Oil spiils from leaking ships <br>
            Mining <br>
        </ul>

        <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
        Air pollutionis making the air unsafe to inhale for living organisms. Examples of activties that contribute to air pollution are as follows:
        <ul>Smoke from wildfires <br>
            Smoke from vehicle exhaust pipes <br>
